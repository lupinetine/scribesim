Transcription mechanics:
if you are starting the process, it is assumed you have the original, ink, pen, paper, and the transcript in some unfinished state.

Begin Transcript process

choose book 
	from personal library
	from inventory
check if there is a transcript in progress
	if so, ask if player wants to continue transcript
	else, ask if player wants to start a new transcript

Check supplies
	Must have at least
		1 pen
		1 ml of ink
		1 sheet of paper

Move sheet to workbench, adds 2 sides to use
Use pen to write down words on the side until it is full or ink runs out, 200 words hardcoded for the moment per page, 5 pages per ml so 1000 words per ml of ink
After writing, add completed number of words to the transcript object and determine how many words are errors, store this error number in the object but do not show the player.  Decrement remaining number of words remaining as well.
